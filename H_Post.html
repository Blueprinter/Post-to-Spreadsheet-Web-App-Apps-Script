      <h1>Welcome to Apps Script World</h1>

        You want interesting, usable and valuable information, and you want it fast.  Well, . . maybe you don't want that, 
        I don't know, but that's what I want.  It's impossible to know everything about programming, the web and products.  
        If you know something valuable, think about posting it here.   You can make a Post, by scrolling down to the "Make a Post" section.
        To make a post, you must approve an Apps Script Web App embeded in this site.  The Web App only asks you to approve one Permission,
        to make an external request.  That's it!  You are not giving the form permission to any other services, or access to your account, 
        so all it can do is send out what you input into the Form.  It does also get your account email address so that people can't 
        anonymously post spam.  The only reason for that external request permission, is write your Post to a spreadsheet.  Just choose a topic,
        and make a post.  And if you don't see a topic listed that you want, make a post in the Comments section of the group, 
        asking for a new topic.    Scroll Down and you'll see the "Topics" page.  
        The Topics page shows all the topic categories that may be of interest to you.  You can browse for information by category.  
        There is no limit to the number of topics that can be created in the database (spreadsheet).   
        So, make a post, or look for information.  To make a post, scroll down to the Post page.  You'll see an input form.
